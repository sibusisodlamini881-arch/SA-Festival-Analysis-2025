🎉 South Africa Festival Impact Analysis (2025)
📌 Overview

This project explores festival ticket sales and economic impact across South Africa in 2025, including major events such as Scorpion Kings Live.

The goal: find the best city to host a large festival with high attendance and maximum economic benefit.

This analysis uses a combination of festival ticket sales data, hotel capacity data, and scenario modeling to guide event organizers, investors, and city planners.

📊 Key Questions

Which South African cities attract the highest festival attendance?

Where do festivals generate the greatest economic impact (ticket revenue, onsite spend, hotel stays)?

How does hotel capacity affect a city’s ability to host large festivals?

Under different scenarios (Conservative, Base, Aggressive), which city offers the best balance of attendance + economic gain?

🛠️ Data

Festival Ticket Sales (2025) – synthetic dataset of attendance across multiple festivals, incl. Scorpion Kings Live.

Hotel Data by City – average room rates & hotel capacity in major SA cities.

Scenario Models – projected variations (Conservative / Base / Aggressive).

📂 Repository structure:

data/          -> Ticket sales & hotel datasets (CSV)
notebooks/     -> Jupyter notebooks (data cleaning, exploration)
dashboards/    -> Power BI files (.pbix) + exported PDF
images/        -> Dashboard screenshots for quick view
README.md      -> Project documentation (this file)

📈 Methods

Data Cleaning – prepared raw festival & hotel data.

Revenue Modeling – calculated:

Ticket Revenue

Onsite Revenue (food, drinks, merch)

Hotel Revenue (attendee stays)

Total Economic Impact (incl. multiplier effect)

Scenario Analysis – modeled outcomes under 3 demand scenarios.

Visualization – built an interactive Power BI dashboard with maps, bar charts, scenario lines, and hotel heatmaps.

📊 Dashboard Highlights

🗺️ Interactive Map – bubbles sized by attendance, colored by economic impact.

📊 Attendance Bar Chart – city-level festival participation.

📊 Economic Impact Stacked Bar – revenue breakdown (ticket, onsite, hotel).

📈 Scenario Line Chart – Base vs Conservative vs Aggressive projections.

🏨 Hotel Occupancy Heatmap – which cities have capacity constraints.

💡 Key Findings

Johannesburg and Cape Town dominate in attendance and impact.

Secondary cities like Durban and Pretoria show strong hotel capacity leverage.

Smaller cities often hit hotel saturation, limiting economic upside.

Under aggressive scenarios, Johannesburg shows the highest impact, but Cape Town balances tourism benefits with hotel availability.

🚀 Results

Best City for Mega Festival (2025) → Johannesburg (attendance & economic impact leader).

Strong Tourism Alternative → Cape Town (high hotel & tourism multipliers).

Strategic Future Cities → Durban & Pretoria (expand hotel capacity to capture bigger events).
